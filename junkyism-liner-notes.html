<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Junkyism is an ode to addictive personalities, consisting of one original and four covers. Though there were many firsts in making this project: setting up mics, playing drums, tuning a piano, performing vocals, producing and mixing … the most important lessons were what I learned about myself. I didn’t realize how obsessively I can focus on a project! And yet, I learned how perfectionism can be a poison, especially when practiced in isolation. I miss making music with other people, and from hereon out I want to collaborate with others as much as possible.</span></p>
